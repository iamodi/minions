						<img src="img/Bob-from-the-minions-movie-1.jpg" width="200px" align="left">

						Bob is a short and bald minion with multi-colored eyes (green and brown). He often carries around a Teddy Bear that he owns called Tim which is brown with yellow buttoned eyes.

						Bob is a minion who is more childish and immature than most. He is described as a "Little Brother" who finds love in anything and everything, including a rat (who he named Poochi) he found in a sewer in the Minions film. He also enjoys bedtime stories and playing with his favorite stuffed teddy bear, Tim.

						Kevin is a tall, two-eyed minion with sprout cut hair and is usually seen wearing his golf apparel.<br><br>

						Kevin loves to make fun of and tease people or Minions, shown when he made fun of Jerry and teases him for being a coward. He loves playing golf and cricket. In Minions he is the leader of the trio in search of a new master. He truly cares about the well-being of the Minion tribe (which is dependent on them having a proper master).
